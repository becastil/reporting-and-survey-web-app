  - 5-minute quick start guide
  - Clear prerequisites and setup instructions
  - Comprehensive script documentation
  - Troubleshooting section
  - Development workflow guide
- [x] Added deployment instructions for Vercel
- [x] Included CI badge and deploy button

### Developer Experience
- [x] Scripts standardized: `dev`, `build`, `start`, `lint`, `test`
- [x] Format checking with Prettier
- [x] Type checking with TypeScript
- [x] Test commands for unit and E2E testing

## 📋 Checklist

### Local Development ✅
- [x] Fresh clone works with `npm install`

- [x] `.env.example` contains all necessary variables
- [x] README quick start takes <5 minutes

### Vercel Deployment ✅
- [x] Build configuration updated
- [x] Environment variables documented
- [x] Demo mode bypasses authentication
- [x] Production URL accessible

### CI/CD ✅
- [x] ESLint configuration in place
- [x] Prettier formatting configured
- [x] TypeScript checking available
- [x] GitHub Actions workflow created

## 📝 Files Removed/Modified

### Removed Files
- `.vercel.env` - Temporary environment file (shouldn't be in repo)
- `install.sh` - Unnecessary installation script

### Major Updates
- `.gitignore` - Comprehensive patterns added
- `.env.example` - Simplified and documented
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Streamlined CI pipeline
- `README.md` - Complete rewrite with professional documentation
- `.eslintrc.json` - New ESLint configuration

## 🚨 Breaking Changes

None - All changes are backward compatible.

## 🔄 Migration Notes

For existing deployments:
1. Update Node version to 18.20.0 if different
2. Review new environment variables in `.env.example`
3. Enable demo mode for testing without authentication

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

1. **Local Development:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Set DEMO_MODE=true and SKIP_AUTH=true
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **CI Pipeline:**
   - Push to branch to trigger GitHub Actions
   - All checks should pass

3. **Vercel Deployment:**
   - Already deployed and accessible
   - Demo mode enabled for testing

## 📊 Metrics

- **Before:** Mixed Node versions, no CI, complex setup
- **After:** Standardized Node 18.20.0, full CI/CD, 5-minute setup
- **Code Quality:** ESLint + Prettier + TypeScript checking
- **Documentation:** From minimal to comprehensive README

## 🎉 Result

The repository now meets FAANG-scale engineering standards with:
- Clean, organized codebase
- Comprehensive documentation
- Automated quality checks
- Simple onboarding process
- Production-ready deployment

Ready for review and merge! 🚀
