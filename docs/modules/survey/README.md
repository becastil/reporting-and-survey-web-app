# Survey Module Documentation

## Module Overview

The Survey module handles all aspects of data ingestion, validation, and processing for the Assured Partners platform. This module transforms raw CSV files with up to 1,200 columns into normalized, validated data ready for analysis.

## ðŸ“‹ Module Contents

- **[requirements.md](./requirements.md)** - Functional requirements and user stories
- **[api-spec.md](./api-spec.md)** - API endpoints for upload and validation
- **[components.md](./components.md)** - UI components for file upload and validation
- **[data-flow.md](./data-flow.md)** - Data processing pipeline and transformations
- **[testing.md](./testing.md)** - Survey-specific test cases and validation

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features

### CSV Upload & Processing
- Drag-and-drop file upload interface
- Support for files up to 1,200 columns
- Automatic encoding detection (UTF-8, UTF-8-BOM, CP1252, etc.)
- Real-time validation with row-level error reporting
- Progress tracking with performance metrics

### Data Validation
- Schema validation against expected format
- Business rule validation (PEPM calculations, member counts)
- Duplicate detection and handling
- Missing data interpolation
- Error recovery and correction suggestions

### Performance Targets
- Process 1,200 columns in < 30 seconds
