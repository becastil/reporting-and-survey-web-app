## Functional Requirements

### File Processing
1. **Supported Formats**

   - TSV (tab-separated)
   - Excel export as CSV

2. **Size Limits**

   - Numeric validation for financial fields
   - Date format validation (YYYY-MM)
   - Positive number validation for counts
   - Non-negative validation for costs

### Header Mapping
The system must intelligently map survey headers to internal fields:

```javascript
Header Patterns:
- "Medical Plan [N] - [Field]" → medical_plan_{n}_{field}
- "Employee Count*" → employee_count
- "Total Members" → member_count
- Various date formats → period (YYYY-MM)
```

### Error Handling
1. **Recoverable Errors**
   - Missing optional columns (use defaults)
   - Extra columns (ignore)
   - Formatting issues (attempt correction)

2. **Non-Recoverable Errors**

   - Invalid file format
   - Corrupted data
   - File too large

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Upload initiation: < 1 second
- Validation complete: < 30 seconds for 1,200 columns
- User feedback: Every 100ms during processing
- Memory usage: < 2GB for largest files

### Security
- Virus scanning on upload
- File type validation (MIME type checking)
- Sanitization of file names
- Secure temporary storage
- Automatic cleanup after processing

### Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader announcements
- Focus management

4. Validate schema
5. Apply business rules
6. Transform data
7. Store in database
8. Generate summary
9. Redirect to dashboard

## Integration Points
