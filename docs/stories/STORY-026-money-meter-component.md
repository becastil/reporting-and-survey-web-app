# STORY-026: Money Meter Component

**Status:** Ready for Review  
**Epic:** MVP Demo Features  
**Feature:** Dashboard Components  

## Story

As a user viewing the dashboard, I want to see the total savings opportunity displayed prominently with an animated counter effect, so I can immediately understand the financial impact of optimization opportunities.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] AC1: Display total savings opportunity value formatted as currency
- [x] AC2: Implement 3-second count-up animation from 0 to final value
- [x] AC3: Show performance badge displaying calculation time (<50ms target)
- [x] AC4: Display trend indicator with percentage change when previous value provided
- [x] AC5: Support click interaction to reveal calculation breakdown
- [x] AC6: Responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
- [x] AC7: WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- [x] AC8: Support high contrast mode
- [x] AC9: Respect prefers-reduced-motion preference
- [x] AC10: Handle edge cases (zero, negative, MAX_SAFE_INTEGER values)
- [x] AC11: Performance optimizations (GPU acceleration, memoization)
- [x] AC12: TypeScript type safety with runtime validation

## Tasks

- [x] Create MoneyMeter component with TypeScript interface
- [x] Implement animated counter using Framer Motion
- [x] Add formatCurrency utility function
- [x] Create withPerformanceTracking HOC
- [x] Implement responsive CSS with CSS Modules
- [x] Add comprehensive unit tests
- [x] Create Storybook stories for all states
- [x] Add runtime validation for defensive programming
- [x] Implement accessibility features (ARIA, keyboard nav)
- [x] Add high contrast and reduced motion support
