# Project Brief: Assured Partners Survey & Reporting Platform

## Executive Summary

**Product Concept:** A cloud-based Survey and Reporting platform for Assured Partners that combines real-time data collection with advanced analytics, enabling organizations to track healthcare benefits performance through interactive visualizations and what-if scenario modeling.

**Primary Problem:** Organizations currently rely on manual CSV collection and static monthly reports to track benefits performance, leading to delayed insights, missed optimization opportunities, and inability to proactively address cost overruns.

**Target Market:** Healthcare benefits brokers and their enterprise clients managing self-funded and fully-insured employee benefit plans.

**Key Value Proposition:** Transform static benefits reporting into dynamic, actionable intelligence with instant what-if modeling that identifies up to $2.3M in addressable savings opportunities through real-time variance analysis and peer benchmarking.

## Problem Statement

**Current State & Pain Points:**
Organizations managing employee healthcare benefits operate in a reactive mode with significant data lag. Benefits administrators receive monthly loss ratio reports 30-45 days after period close, making it impossible to course-correct in real-time. The current workflow involves:
- Manual CSV collection from 40+ organizations each survey cycle
- Static PDF reports showing claims vs. budget with no interactivity
- Excel-based analysis requiring 8-12 hours per month for variance investigation
- No ability to compare performance against peer organizations
- Missing rebates and timing issues obscured until quarter-end reconciliation

**Impact of the Problem:**
Based on the data analyzed, organizations are experiencing:
- Average 4.2% PEPM variance ($2.3M addressable across portfolio)
- 60% of variance driven by Rx rebate timing issues (preventable with visibility)
- 2× stop-loss incidence in self-funded PPOs vs. EPOs (unknown until claims processed)
- 3-month delay in identifying cost trend reversals
- Zero proactive intervention capability when trends exceed targets

**Why Existing Solutions Fall Short:**
Current tools (spreadsheets, static BI reports, carrier portals) fail because they:
- Treat each month in isolation without pattern recognition
- Lack what-if modeling to test intervention strategies
- Don't surface peer benchmarks for context
- Require manual data aggregation across multiple sources
- Provide no real-time alerts or predictive indicators

**Urgency & Importance:**
With Q1 2024 budgets already set and Q2 planning underway, organizations need immediate visibility to:
- Adjust Q2 funding before lock-in (February deadline)
- Negotiate carrier rebate timing before annual renewal
- Shift enrollment to narrow networks during open enrollment
- Prevent another year of 4-7% cost overruns

## Proposed Solution

**Core Concept & Approach:**
An integrated Survey and Reporting platform that transforms benefits management from reactive reporting to proactive optimization. The solution combines automated data collection via intelligent surveys with real-time analytical dashboards, enabling instant what-if scenario modeling and peer benchmarking. The platform operates as a continuous feedback loop: collect → analyze → model → optimize → measure.

**Key Differentiators:**
- **Instant What-If Modeling:** Sliders for rebate timing and enrollment shifts with 42ms recalculation showing immediate PEPM impact
- **Cohort Intelligence:** "Organizations Like Yours" automated peer grouping based on 5 dimensions (funding, carrier, plan type, network, size)
- **Unified Data Flow:** Single filter bar drives both Survey and Reporting modules, eliminating context switching
- **Predictive Indicators:** Cost Pressure Index with 3-month forecast based on rebate patterns and stop-loss trends
- **Visual Impact:** Waterfall variance breakdowns, achievement badges, and "$2.3M Opportunity" meters that make insights unmissable

**Why This Solution Will Succeed:**
- **Speed Advantage:** 42ms recalculation vs. 8-hour Excel analysis
- **Actionability:** Every insight paired with specific intervention (e.g., "Shift 10% to narrow network = -$X PEPM")
- **Trust Building:** Transparent calculations with drill-down capability from summary to line-item
- **Engagement Design:** Gamification elements (streaks, badges) drive consistent platform usage
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Focus view (5 key metrics) for executives, Advanced view for analysts

**High-Level Vision:**
Transform Assured Partners from benefits administrator to strategic optimizer. The platform becomes the command center for benefits intelligence, enabling proactive interventions that consistently deliver 3-5% cost savings while improving employee satisfaction through better plan design.

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints

- **Budget:** Limited development budget requiring phased approach; MVP must demonstrate value for additional funding
- **Timeline:** Hard deadline for demo tomorrow (January 25, 2024); production MVP needed by end of Q1 2024
- **Resources:** Small development team (2-3 developers); relying on existing Assured Partners domain expertise
- **Technical:** 
  - Must work with existing CSV data format (cannot modify source systems)
  - Limited to monthly data refresh cycles (real-time not feasible)
  - Cannot access carrier APIs without partnership agreements
  - Must operate within current Assured Partners security policies

### Key Assumptions

- CSV data format will remain consistent across all 40 organizations
- Monthly data will be available by the 5th business day without fail
- Users have modern browsers and stable internet connections
- Assured Partners has authority to use client data for peer comparisons
- The $2.3M savings opportunity is achievable and measurable
- Demo environment can use production data (properly de-identified)
- Benefits administrators will champion adoption without mandatory training
- Current Excel-based workflows can be fully replaced (not supplemented)
- Performance targets (42ms) are achievable with current data volumes
- Single-tenant architecture is acceptable for 12-month horizon

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks

- **Data Quality Risk:** CSV data may have inconsistencies, missing values, or format variations that break calculations and undermine trust in the platform
- **Performance Risk:** 480 rows × complex calculations may not achieve 42ms target, especially with multiple concurrent users during demo
- **Adoption Risk:** Benefits administrators comfortable with Excel may resist change, preferring familiar tools despite inefficiencies
- **Security Risk:** Healthcare data requires strict compliance; any breach or perceived vulnerability could terminate project immediately
- **Integration Risk:** Future carrier API access may be blocked by technical or contractual barriers, limiting platform evolution
- **Scope Creep Risk:** Demo success may create unrealistic expectations for full platform delivery timeline

### Open Questions

- Who is the primary stakeholder for tomorrow's demo - technical team or business executives?
- What is the exact format and schema of the current CSV data structure?
- Are there existing authentication systems we need to integrate with?
- What percentage of the $2.3M opportunity needs validation to proceed?
- How sensitive is the data - are we dealing with PHI requiring HIPAA compliance?
- Will Assured Partners provide dedicated resources for requirements and testing?
- What happens if the demo identifies critical missing features?

### Areas Needing Further Research

- Optimal caching strategies for maintaining 42ms performance at scale
- Legal review of peer benchmarking and data aggregation permissions
- Competitive analysis of existing benefits analytics platforms (Artemis, Springbuk)
- Technical feasibility of WebGPU visualizations in current browsers
- Change management best practices for Excel-to-platform transitions
- ROI calculation methodology to validate claimed savings
- Backup data sources if CSV pipeline fails
