# Brainstorming Session: Assured Partners Demo Enhancement
**Date:** 2024-01-24
**Technique:** SCAMPER Method
**Goal:** Focused ideation for tomorrow's demo - enhancing visual impact for Survey and Reporting modules

## Session Context
- **Topic:** Enhancing demo visuals and flow for Assured Partners Web Application
- **Constraints:** Cloud deployment, demo tomorrow, must-have visuals for both modules
- **Focus:** Making the demo compelling and memorable for the team

- Show ACTUAL loss ratio data: claims and expenses vs budget
- Display REAL breakdowns: rebates, stop loss payments, fixed admin costs
- Include DE-IDENTIFIED high-cost claimants data

**Visualization Substitutions:**
- Replace standard charts with:
  - WebGPU-powered 3D visualizations for massive data rendering
  - Scrollytelling narratives for executive summaries
  - Horizon charts for ultra-high density time series
  - Flow maps for claims movement visualization
  - Sonified alerts for threshold breaches

**Input Method Substitutions:**
- Voice input for survey responses
- Camera capture for document uploads
- NFC taps for quick data entry
- Payment sheet API for claims processing

**Interactive Element Substitutions:**
- Live form builder with immediate preview
- Real-time validation with row-by-row feedback
- Animated module cards that scale on hover
