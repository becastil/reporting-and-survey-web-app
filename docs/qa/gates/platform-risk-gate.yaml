    title: 'SQL Injection via CSV Upload'
  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - 'Add authentication middleware to all API routes'
      - 'Parameterize all database queries to prevent SQL injection'
      - 'Implement data encryption at rest for PII protection'
      - 'Add pagination and limits to prevent unbounded queries'
      - 'Implement CSRF protection on all state-changing operations'
    monitor:
      - 'Set up security alerts for authentication failures'
      - 'Monitor database query performance and slow queries'
      - 'Track memory usage and implement alerts at 80% threshold'
      - 'Add error rate monitoring with 1% threshold alerts'
      - 'Implement audit logging for all data access'
