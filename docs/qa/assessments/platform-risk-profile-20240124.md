## Recommendations for Immediate Action

### Critical Actions (Do Now)
1. **Add authentication middleware** to all API routes

2. Add health check endpoints
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Create deployment documentation

## Risk Score Justification

Starting from 100 points:
- 4 Critical risks × 20 points = -80 points
- 6 High risks × 10 points = -60 points  
- 8 Medium risks × 5 points = -40 points
- 5 Low risks × 2 points = -10 points

**Final Score: 35/100** (High Risk)

This score indicates significant security and performance risks that must be addressed before production deployment. The platform has a solid foundation but requires immediate attention to critical security vulnerabilities and performance bottlenecks.
